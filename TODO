// Stuff to do!

* Explosions should interact with subs, missles, and the destroyer
* Take a look at the ship key-movement code. Should it act more like the
  stuff used to control the release of the depth-charge?
* Add subs to the game at an increasing frequency over time at random depths
* Start keeping track of how many subs are destroyed and display as a score
* End the game when the destroyer is hit. Display GameOver and # subs destroyed
